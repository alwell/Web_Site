{"name":"Buddha Code","tagline":"Zolag home","body":"**GREETINGS** and a **BIG WAVE** to **all SURFERS**.  We are publishers of Buddhist books\r\nand articles. Currently we have several books in print (published under the imprint of Zolag) and on this site thousands\r\nof pages of books and articles for free download. We also have several unique books on various topics from the 'abhidhamma', `the theory of buddhism'. The aim of these books is to bridge the gap between theory and practice and help to give a precision to the  understanding of buddhism.\r\n\r\n> TIP: If you are a beginner and want to get to grips with the core of Buddhism quickly-here is a quarter page article [Abhidhamma in Daily Life press release](https://github.com/alwell/Zolag_Archive/blob/master/Abhidhamma%20in%20Daily%20Life/ADL_PR.md), and a short 5 page article [Understanding Reality](https://github.com/alwell/Zolag_Archive/tree/master/Understanding%20Reality/ur.md).
